# 📊 Call Center Optimization Dashboard – Power BI Insights for Performance Excellence

Welcome to a data-driven initiative crafted to elevate call center performance through **strategic analytics**, **visual intelligence**, and **precision decision-making**.

This Power BI dashboard empowers telecom operations to deliver exceptional service while optimizing operational cost — offering decision-makers a **360-degree view** of agent behavior, customer satisfaction, and topic-specific challenges that impact overall efficiency.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The core mission is simple yet powerful:

> **Maximize Customer Satisfaction** and **Minimize Operational Cost** — achieving the highest quality of service with the lowest cost possible.

To realize this vision, we focused on two key pillars:
- 📉 **Reducing Abandonment Rate**
- ✅ **Increasing Call Resolution Rate**

These goals were supported by a deep exploration of agent-level data, time-based patterns, topic-specific challenges, and resource utilization insights — all visualized and analyzed in Power BI for strategic action.

## 💡 Strategic Insights & Key Findings

### 🛑 Abandonment Rate: A Solvable Challenge

- The **overall abandonment rate** stands at **19%**, which can be significantly improved.
- Astonishingly, **40% of abandoned calls occur during just two hours daily** — **9:00 AM** and **12:00 PM**.
- Agent-specific trends reveal:
  - At **9 AM**, **Greg, Diane, and Stewart** contribute to **70%** of the hour’s abandonment.
  - At **12 PM**, **Jim, Dan, and Stewart** account for **78%** of missed calls.

📌 **Solution:** Strategic reallocation of workforce during these two peak hours can prevent nearly half of all daily abandonments — a simple yet high-impact optimization.

On **Tuesdays and Wednesdays**, the last hour of operation (**6:00 PM**) shows a 50% spike in abandonment. However, due to the **very low call volume and agent utilization** at this time:

👉 **Recommendation:** Shift closing time from 6:00 PM to **5:00 PM**. This reduces cost while freeing up resources to reinforce peak hours — optimizing both budget and outcome.

### 🧩 Resolution Rate: Empowering Agents with Precision Training

Delivering solutions efficiently is at the heart of customer satisfaction. The data reveals:

- **Technical Support** and **Payment Related** inquiries have the **lowest resolution rates** — both at **72%**.
- Individual agent performance highlights areas of opportunity:
  - **Martha**: Lowest in **Streaming (65%)** and **Technical Support (68%)**
  - **Diane**: Struggles with **Contract Related (67%)** and **Payment Related (68%)**

🎯 **Action Plan:** Provide **tailored training** to address agent-specific weaknesses and elevate resolution outcomes across these high-impact categories.

### ⏱️ Handle Time vs Answer Rate: Where Time Hurts Quality

Efficiency isn’t just about speed — it’s about solving fast and right. Some topics require disproportionate time, leading to delays in service:

- **Technical Support** has the **lowest answer rate (79%)** and the **highest average handle time (225 seconds)**.
- Other high-handle-time topics include:
  - **Streaming**
  - **Admin Support**
  - **Contract Related**

📌 **Recommendation:** Invest in advanced training and distribute staffing more effectively to these critical topics. Elevating agent proficiency can compress handle times and improve answer rates — directly enhancing customer experience.
